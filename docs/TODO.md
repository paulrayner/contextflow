# TODO

## High Priority

Currently no high priority tasks.

## Backlog

**Strategic View Enhancements:**
- [ ] Organic blob-based group rendering (see Milestone 6 in [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md))

**Team Flow:**
- [ ] Consider developing separate integrated tool for team flow (similar to CodeCohesion https://lnkd.in/grhy_XRp)
- [ ] Note: Flow view is currently more value stream than actual team flow

**Team Topologies:**
- [ ] Enhance Team Topologies implementation with more substance (currently mostly conceptual)
- [ ] Add visual team topology rendering on canvas (e.g., interaction modes between teams)

**Quality of Life:**
- [ ] Add search/filter for contexts, repos, teams
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts documentation overlay (Cmd/Ctrl+?)
- [ ] Add onboarding/tutorial for first-time users
- [ ] Add example projects library (beyond ACME and cBioPortal)
